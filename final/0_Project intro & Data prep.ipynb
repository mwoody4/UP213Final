    "# SNAP Gap in Los Angeles County: Spatial Patterns and Predictors\n",
    "#### Meaghan Woody\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Urban Planning 213 Final Project \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Background:**\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the most urgent priorities for anti-hunger nonprofit organizations and CalFresh agencies in California is targeted outreach to eligible but unenrolled households. However, few tools exist to systematically identify communities where enrollment is low, even though need is high. “SNAP Gap” refers to the proportion of those who are eligible but not enrolled in Federally funded Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP). California ranks significantly lower than half the US (81% in 2022, 67% in 2020), yet has the highest number of SNAP recipients (USDA, 2022). In 2020, it was reported there is an estimated 280,000 LA County households who remain eligible for but are not receiving CalFresh. In general, to get CalFresh benefits, the household's gross income must be less than the gross-income eligibility standard 130% of the Federal Poverty Level (FPL).\n",
    "\n",
    "Understanding neighborhood-level aspects of SNAP participation can greatly inform outreach efforts. Mapping tools can help identify and share opportunities to maximize efforts by targeting local areas with the lowest participation rates. Low SNAP participation rates in California cannot be attributed to a single factor but rather a multitude of factors that span across policy, politics, administration, demographics, and cultural attitudes, therefore this project aims to identify predictors of SNAP gap through an exploratory analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Research aims:** \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Map the distribution of SNAP gap and food insecurity in Los Angeles County in varying geographic units.\n",
    "2. Conduct a spatial cluster analysis of SNAP gap rates\n",
    "3. Identify predictors that explain SNAP gap using machine learning models trained on American Community Survey (ACS) variables.\n",
